PHP Powered Blow Using MVC
=======

A basic blog written using PHP. Utilizes the MVC application architecture to show beginners how to use it.

Currently has the ability to list all posts and show specific ones. Commenting is also implemented. The ability to post new posts will probably never be implemented and as such you will have to add them through an application such as phpMyAdmin.
